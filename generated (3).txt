0: Life is not always sunshine and rainbows, some days more than others. Sometimes it rains but the sun never shineeth over this dark place that I call life." - Dante Alighieri poem 
"We are born to die, But if we should kill ourselves, then Life itself shall not end"God made all things have a meaning, even death
It was so easy for everyone elseTo give up on their dreamsAnd leave everythingThey thought they knew to be true;But in truth They're just lying to themselvesThere's no answer to love
Forces far greaterThen your ownSelfThese last few lines may sound eerily familiar as those of Hozier or Beckett, but ask yourself what do you want from these words? 
To find an escape route out here of meaninglessness where nothing can ever go wrong except us living inside our heads forever doomed by our very brains existing in such a cruel reality?
My brain tells me every dayThat there's nothing worth going anywhere In Life other Then my AnxietyFeelingsFoggy, blurry thoughts filled with fearI see only black and white; 
shades between now And shades beyondThat burn slowly eating away at my faith; religionI used too quickly becoming like The Joker;The man who came after the Cat died
This hell is hopeless and It looks like Only God knowsHow long i'll live without hope


1: Life is too hard" when I'm doing very well.


2: Life is so confusing right now, I just dont know what to do


3: Life is hard. Life sucks." "I just feel like I'm at rock bottom and have no other choice but to endure this shit until my death" 
"life's a bitch". You get the idea, you don't sound depressed on here anymore, do ya know that? We're not gonna let those voices of our fathers control us any longer! 
We've got these motherfuckers running amuck in life; they need fucking fired. These arenutiful little people; we're better than them AT FUCKING THINKING, NOT ACTUALLY HATING!! 
[Verse 1:08-2]They act all nice sometimes (as long as nobody hears me cryin). But when they see me crying, it makes their day *less* because now 
THEY'RE HAPPY AND CAN MESS WITH MY LIFE AS MUCH WHILE IM CRYING FOR NO REASON!!![Chorus - 2x10 Freestyle]Watching myself be bashful while i make out wiggling fake smile? 
Feeling myself slip away into a song only for it  To fade back again?And so easily forgotten about by those who should careSo easily lost yet im still haunted


4: Life is so hard, my life isn't even worth living. I need help to feel alive again and i don;t know how
