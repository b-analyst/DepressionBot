0: It all started when I was around 15 years old. I will never forget the day it happened, it's like a dream. 
It was in August and my family were out having fun on vacation when suddenly this huge monster of an SUV drove by 
and almost hit me as its tires screeched! That experience terrified even more because that event also increased how 
scared Id get whenever anyone tried to touch or talk near those areas where I felt dp'd. 
Ever since then these intense defensive mechanisms have been built into myself somehow which means anytime someone tries t ask for 
directions from within 100 feet of any road surface, especially if they are driving fast, Im already setting way too quick resistance 
whether intentionally/ unintentionally (Ive learned over time not letting certain people get close bc thats what worked best for ME personally). 
My SO has dealt with these situations before but he is usually able figure things out eventually and navigate thru them without incident 
BUT there ARE some super weird situations lately where this issue comes back at him almost everytime hes out running late at night
(fast forward less than 24 hours) and triggers extremely badly despite being relatively level headed prior.
(For context: his work doesnt require nearly 40+ hour weeks so id expect long days n quite often although we do try our absolute best worts here &there.) 
Over covid however...this really only got worse. As soon i left home school ended abruptly; thankfully he completed highschool early though unlike most 
who quit after their first year / two+. Fast forward another few months and i hadnt moved away from our hometown AT ALL for several reasons-
i live alone due to corona virus restrictions making it virtually impossible ive ever set foot outside my house in panic mode unless necessary yet again unfortunately)-
my SO works part Time at nearby university along side other colleagues providing crucial healthcare while im gone and thus far nothing 
seems amiss regarding health issues aside form occasionally nausea thanks largely be tween anxiety -my biggest fear growing up WAS getting kidnapped..
which sadly i havent witnessed once except briefly during quarantine itself partially caused strictly bpd related trauma among many others.
-my own personal coping mechanisms seem pretty ineffective IMO. They mainly consist essentially fleeing until safe distance arrives or my SO gets home-
if you know anything about ptsd let us know in comments cause ill make sure no one goes off reddit solely based upon your experience. Thank u for reading 


1: It all started when I left my abusive house and went to live with a family. This involved living out of an 18 pack in basically the middle OF nowhere, 
sleeping on someone's floor, not having any human interaction other than eating cereal/yogurt, etc - but also being forced into sexual intimacy with an adult man (I'm 28). 
It was traumatic for me as it happened yet again completely without cause at that time; however by moving away from home something else changed: i became less hyper vigilant 
about abandonment issues like getting rejected or feeling abandoned / ignored so those feelings were no longer a huge issue anymore because *now* there is no reason we can't be friends!
Now I'm happy to say after 5 years since then...it has finally hit us that we are actually good together AND have boundaries!!! He does treat ME well even though most days everything feels HORRIBLE, 
which makes this such relief!!My biggest fear now IS him leaving me which leaves MY BPD symptoms worsening - although he assures Me every day if hed leave id still text & talk everyday 
(and his words ever since have been reassuring). But We do indeed get along great right Now despite these fears so I feel hopeful for our future :)


2: It all started when I had an episode of rapid cycling that eventually led me to a state hospitalization. Ever since then, the depression has only gotten more terrible and now is possibly 
my worst bout in nearly ten years (or at least it feels like this). The doctor said Im depressed primarily due  mostly from lack o have any form ot work or social outlets which obviously 
put alot OF THE burden on coping mechanisms such as video games/watching series etc... While trying desperately not go off the vent inpatient, they prescribed Celexa along with Wellbutrin 
for anxiety but apparently thats just added stress because she doesnt work long hours. Theyre giving her Prozac 20mg right away so Ill get those two things hopefully im able tine myself out soon!! 
I want help and its hard being alone.... Not really sure how much longer Id be here without it


3: It all started when I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 17. Since then, my life has been defined by it and dealing with the consequences of that (treatments/meds etc). 
I'm 32 now & for as long i've known about ADD there has always seemed to be a part or something else connecting me to this disorder... specifically trauma - 
that's just never gone away completely but over time its gotten way lessened. After speaking some more in depth w both myself / doctors 
(and also seeing a counsellor who specialises In ADHD) I feel like what im experiencing isnt dissociation per say so much fragmented emotion. 
Instead It feels very similar if not exactly real? Like i'll suddenly have loads on tv because one minute I might find joy living another day completely drained emotionally.. 
which leads into feeling empty knowing i haven't made progress healing whatever *is* wrong with ive got going On. Sometimes, ill even get flashbacks to events from years ago where everything seems so blurry.. 
unreal.. and sometimes they last for hours on end before fading back in blissful numbness. At times too will replay old cringe/memories repeatedly in order remind yourself why you were 
such an angry child. Its hard writing ALL THIS out especially since nobody really seems quite sure what caused any issues wheter ever.... idk maybe cuz it could Be childhood stress thats causing this. 
But ultimately rn, i don'T want nor need answers... im simply looking FOR TRIGGERS! Just wondering if anyone can relate either personally OR whether this is worth addressing plz??


4: It all started when I was 16, so about 12 years ago. But I've been depressed since then as well (16-21)I'm not a bad person but my mom says that because of this depression and anxiety 
they have given me some serious problems in the bedroom:One day she says "You're young! You don't even know what's good for you!" and then gets angry with everyone, 
especially her younger siblings who didn0t say anything to annoy or hurt them ever... It wasn(nearly every time), the same way whenever people did something annoying /shamed us:
My sister said things like:"You can get over it if your parents were better equipped to deal",etcBut at least from 15 until now those weren<---the only kind/kindest arguments i could have with anyone 
- cause my mother and dad are still divorcedThey are completely insensitive towards everything i do sometimes&#x200B;sometimes their tone makei=1027;it hard justto breathe..&ENDS....
