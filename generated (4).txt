0: I wonder when the day comes where my dreams will be about me being a normal human, not some weirdo who only exists to serve others.


1: I wonder when people have really been there, and taken care of their mom/dads etc. but I never had that in my life?


2: I wonder when people started getting pregt or having kids...what their sexual orientations were before the introduction of the pill.
My psychiatrist is great, but my social anxiety, depression and bipolar are so bad, that I can't even go out to have a cup coffee with friends atm without 
feeling anxious about it because im afraid they will ask me what brings you pleasure etc


3: I wonder when a person is in mania or hypomanic state. I feel that way sometimes and think it's cool, but usually i wouldnt associate myself 
with that part of manias. But then the other times its more positive... i'm so happy and social and doing well with life overall..? 
Is this dissociation mixed states thing?? Idk if my mind just doesnt let me know these are mixed phases, cause otherwise Im always thinking about how im manic and can never relax lol


4: I wonder when it will end... I don't know how long I can live like this.
